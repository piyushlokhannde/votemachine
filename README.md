# Voting Machine
EVM based on cryptography

Any voting system should have the following characteristics.
1) **confidentiality:** System should be confidential about the voter and there choices.
2) **Validation:** Voter should be able to validate the choices they made.
3) **Integrity:** Once all the choces are made, their should not be any temporing of the data recoreded in the system.

Although the current voting system(EVM) take cares of the confidentiality but hardly any thing for Validation and Integrity.
With the help of cryptography and blockachiain data structure, we can improve on the validation and integrity of the EVM's
The example presented here is an CEVM , based on the cryptography and  blockachiain data structure to demonstrate the implementation of the confidentiality, validation and integrity
