# Voting Machine
EVM based on cryptography

Any voting system should have the following characteristics.
1) **confidentiality:** System should be confidential about the voter and there choices.
2) **Validation:** Voter should be able to validate the choices they made.
3) **Integrity:** Once all the choces are made, their should not be any temporing of the data recoreded in the system.

Although the current voting system(EVM) take cares of the confidentiality but hardly any thing for Validation and Integrity.
